Wishlist:
- add option to exclude files (for backing up entire systems, also gvfs problems)
- add option to backup over network - see man rsync for details

Check:
- check if permissions properly preserved - ie, if root runs, can user access personal files?

Learning:
- read up on cron, add documentation to cron.sh

Optional:
- create install script? or at least document how to install the script
